${inputs.placed_at_utc} UTC+0 = You placed this Stop-Market order.  

**Trigger Condition:** ${inputs.trigger_type}  
**Trigger Price:** ${inputs.trigger_price}  

When you place a Stop-Market order with the Last Price trigger condition, it will trigger a market order as soon as Last Price reaches the trigger level, and the market order will be executed immediately.  

${inputs.triggered_at_utc} UTC+0 = The Last Price reached your trigger price and the Market order was triggered.  
Market order executed from the price of: **${inputs.executed_price}**  

The Last Price details for that minute were:  

${lastBlock}  

So the reason your stop order was filled at a different price and resulted in higher losses is because a **Stop-Market order is a conditional market order**.  
Unlike limit orders, a market order doesn‚Äôt guarantee the filling price but ensures immediate execution at the best available price. This difference is called *slippage* and is expected when using stop-market orders.
